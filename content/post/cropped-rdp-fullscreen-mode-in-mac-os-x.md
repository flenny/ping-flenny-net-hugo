When adding a new Remote Desktop connection using the official Microsoft Mac App Store
{{% a_blank "Remote Desktop" "https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12" %}} app
on my MacBook, the default value for full screen mode is to use all available monitors.
This results in a few pixels missing on top of the screen. Disabling this option will fix this issue.
